# 19-Bit CPU Architecture - Complete Verilog Implementation

## Architecture Overview

This is a specialized 19-bit CPU designed for signal processing and cryptography applications. The architecture features a 5-stage pipeline with dedicated instructions for FFT operations and encryption/decryption.

## Key Features
- 19-bit instruction width
- 16 general-purpose registers (R0-R15)
- 5-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB)
- Specialized DSP and cryptographic instructions
- Hazard detection and forwarding unit
- Compatible with EDA Playground

## Instruction Format

```
Bit Layout: [18:15] [14:11] [10:7] [6:3] [2:0]
            OPCODE   RS1    RS2   RD/IMM FUNC
```

## Pipeline Stages
1. **IF (Instruction Fetch)**: Fetch instruction from memory
2. **ID (Instruction Decode)**: Decode instruction and read registers
3. **EX (Execute)**: ALU operations and address calculation
4. **MEM (Memory Access)**: Load/Store operations
5. **WB (Write Back)**: Write results back to register file

## Specialized Instructions
- **FFT**: Fast Fourier Transform operation
- **ENC**: Encryption using AES-like algorithm
- **DEC**: Decryption using AES-like algorithm
